They are also frequently filled with clouds. In July 2015, Landsat 8 captured this view of the cloud\\-filled canyons through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into the Pacific Ocean.You can’t see it, but the Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left. The clouds are marine stratocumulus—a type of low\\-level cloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile, developing most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland. Because the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where low valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.\n",

The easternmost reaches of Russia, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left. To the east, sea ice spans the Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.The cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea ice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop. Clouds form along the upward cycle in the cylinders, where air is rising, and skies remain clear along the downward cycle, where air is falling. The cloud streets run toward the southwest in this image from the Terra satellite.\n",

The collision off the coast of Mauritania produces a wave structure in the atmosphere. Called an undular bore or solitary wave, this cloud formation was created by the interaction between cool, dry air coming off the continent and running into warm, moist air over the ocean. The winds blowing out from the land push a wave of air ahead like a bow wave moving ahead of a boat. Parts of these waves are favorable for cloud formation, while other parts are not. The dust blowing out from Africa appears to be riding these waves. Dust has been known to affect cloud growth, but it probably has little to do with the cloud pattern observed here.\n",

Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case, the Sun). Although glories may look similar to rainbows, the way light is scattered to produce them is different. Rainbows are formed by refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.Note, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run into an obstacle—the island of Guadalupe—and form a wake behind it.\n",

Due to their remote location, these volcanoes are some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting. The combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural\\-color imagery. But using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites to distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false\\-color image in September 2016\\. Note the three bright white plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) around them.Researchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather. The tiny solid and liquid particles in the plume (aerosols) act as seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.\n",

It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, airborne dust, white\\-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high\\-pressure weather systems, as they did here.\n",

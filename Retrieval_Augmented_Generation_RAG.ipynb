Due to their remote location, these volcanoes are some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting. The combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural\\-color imagery. But using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites to distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false\\-color image in September 2016\\. Note the three bright white plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) around them.Researchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather. The tiny solid and liquid particles in the plume (aerosols) act as seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.\n",

It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, airborne dust, white\\-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high\\-pressure weather systems, as they did here.\n",
